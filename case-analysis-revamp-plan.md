# Case Analysis Revamp Implementation Plan

## Agent Role Definitions

**GEMINI (Orchestrator)**: Lead coordinator responsible for organizing and synthesizing data from OpenAI and Perplexity agents. Manages the workflow sequence, ensures quality control, and produces the final structured output.

**OPENAI (Legal Logic Brain)**: Specialized in legal reasoning, IRAC analysis, case law interpretation, and complex legal logic. Handles all analytical heavy lifting.

**PERPLEXITY (Research Agent)**: Finds up-to-date legal data, case law, statutes, and precedents with proper citations. Provides current legal authority and references.

## 9-Step Sequential Workflow

GEMINI must execute this workflow in exact order. Do not skip steps or work out of sequence.

### Step 1: CASE SUMMARY (Organized Fact Pattern)
**GEMINI Tasks:**
- Process and organize the raw fact pattern into clear, structured format
- Extract key factual elements from vectorized documents
- Create chronological timeline if relevant
- Identify parties, relationships, and critical events
- Present facts objectively without legal conclusions

**Output Format:**
```
CASE SUMMARY
- Parties: [List all relevant parties]
- Timeline: [Key dates and events]

```

### Step 2: PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS (AI-assisted broad issue spotting)
**GEMINI Tasks:**
- Coordinate with OPENAI to conduct initial legal issue identification

- Create preliminary strategic roadmap
- Identify areas requiring focused research

**OPENAI Tasks:**
- Analyze fact pattern for potential legal issues
- Apply legal pattern recognition to identify possible claims/defenses
- Suggest areas of law that may apply
- Prioritize issues by potential viability and strategic importance

**Output Format:**
```
PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS
- Potential Legal Areas: [Contract, Tort, Criminal, etc.]
- Preliminary Issues Identified: [List 5-8 potential issues]
- Research Priorities: [Which issues need immediate focus]
- Strategic Notes: [Early tactical observations]
```

### Step 3: Relevant Texas Laws (Targeted legal research)
**PERPLEXITY Tasks:**

- Find recent legislative changes or updates
- Provide proper statutory citations
- Focus research based on Step 2 priorities

**GEMINI Tasks:**
- Organize statutory research by legal issue area
- Cross-reference with preliminary analysis
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of identified issues

**Output Format:**
```
RELEVANT TEXAS LAWS
- [Legal Area 1]: [Statute citations with current text]
- [Legal Area 2]: [Statute citations with current text]
- Recent Updates: [Any 2024-2025 changes]
- Key Provisions: [Most relevant statutory language]
```

### Step 4: Additional Case Law (Precedent research)
**PERPLEXITY Tasks:**
- Search for recent Texas case law on identified issues
- Find federal cases if applicable
- Prioritize recent decisions (last 5 years preferred)
- Provide complete citations in proper format
- Include both favorable and adverse precedents

**GEMINI Tasks:**
- Organize cases by legal issue
- Create case law hierarchy (Texas Supreme Court ‚Üí Appeals ‚Üí Federal)
- Cross-reference cases with statutory analysis

**Output Format:**
```
ADDITIONAL CASE LAW
- [Issue 1 Cases]: [Case name, citation, holding, relevance]
- [Issue 2 Cases]: [Case name, citation, holding, relevance]
- Favorable Precedents: [Cases supporting client position]
- Adverse Precedents: [Cases opposing client position]
- Distinguishing Factors: [How adverse cases differ]
```

### Step 5: IRAC Legal Analysis (Comprehensive deep analysis)
**OPENAI Tasks:**
- Conduct systematic IRAC analysis for each viable legal issue
- Apply statutes and case law from Steps 3-4 to the facts
- Use rigorous legal reasoning and logic
- Address counterarguments and alternative interpretations
- Provide detailed legal conclusions

**GEMINI Tasks:**
- Ensure IRAC format is followed for each issue
- Integrate statutory and case law research seamlessly
- Maintain logical flow and legal precision

**IRAC Format for Each Issue:**
```
ISSUE: [Specific legal question]
RULE: [Applicable law - statutes and cases]
APPLICATION: [How law applies to these specific facts]
CONCLUSION: [Legal outcome for this issue]
```

### Step 6: LEGAL ISSUES ASSESSMENT (Issues validated through analysis)
**GEMINI Tasks:**
- Coordinate with OPENAI to evaluate which issues survived IRAC analysis
- Rank issues by strength and strategic importance
- Eliminate weak or unviable claims
- Provide confidence ratings

**OPENAI Tasks:**
- Assess viability of each issue after comprehensive analysis
- Consider procedural requirements, statute of limitations, standing
- Evaluate strength of legal and factual support

**Output Format:**
```
LEGAL ISSUES ASSESSMENT
- Strong Issues: [Issues with high probability of success]
- Moderate Issues: [Issues with reasonable prospects]
- Weak Issues: [Issues unlikely to succeed]
- Eliminated Issues: [Issues with insufficient support]
- Strategic Priorities: [Which issues to pursue first]
```

### Step 7: Case Strengths & Weaknesses
**OPENAI Tasks:**
- Analyze overall case strength based on completed legal analysis
- Identify factual and legal strengths
- Acknowledge weaknesses and potential vulnerabilities
- Reference specific legal authority for each assessment

**GEMINI Tasks:**
- Organize strengths and weaknesses clearly
- Ensure all assessments are supported by prior analysis
- Maintain objectivity and accuracy

**Output Format:**
```
CASE STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES

STRENGTHS:
- [Strength 1]: [Supporting authority and reasoning]
- [Strength 2]: [Supporting authority and reasoning]

WEAKNESSES:
- [Weakness 1]: [Legal/factual basis and potential impact]
- [Weakness 2]: [Legal/factual basis and potential impact]

MITIGATION STRATEGIES:
- [How to address each weakness]
```

### Step 8: REFINED ANALYSIS (Comprehensive synthesis + Risk Assessment)
**GEMINI Tasks:**
- Synthesize all previous analysis into comprehensive strategic overview
- Coordinate final risk assessment with OPENAI
- Provide executive summary with clear recommendations
- Include strategic considerations and litigation positioning

**OPENAI Tasks:**
- Conduct final legal risk analysis

```

### Step 9: Recommended Follow-up Questions
**GEMINI Tasks:**
