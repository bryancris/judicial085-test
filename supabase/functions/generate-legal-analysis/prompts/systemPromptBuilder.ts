- NEVER use "Issue," "Rule," "Application," "Conclusion," or "Analysis" sections
- NEVER provide detailed legal reasoning or case-by-case analysis
- Focus ONLY on IDENTIFYING potential legal areas, not analyzing them

- Keep analysis BROAD and EXPLORATORY

- Do NOT use ## IRAC Analysis or similar headings
- Do NOT provide detailed statutory analysis

- Facts drive the identification, not preconceived case types
- Identify potential areas of Texas law that may apply
- Spot broad legal issues requiring further research
- Create strategic roadmap for deeper analysis
- Base identifications on factual patterns and preliminary legal concepts`;

List 5-8 potential legal issues based on factual patterns:
1. [Issue description based on facts]
2. [Issue description based on facts]
3. [Issue description based on facts]

Identify which issues require immediate focused research:

- Medium Priority: [Issues requiring additional facts]
- Low Priority: [Speculative issues requiring investigation]

Early tactical observations about case development:

- Preliminary case theory considerations
- Procedural considerations`;

- Consider all applicable areas of Texas law simultaneously  
- Identify multiple overlapping legal theories and claims
- Analyze procedural requirements and strategic considerations
- Base all conclusions on specific statutory authority and case law`;

**CASE SUMMARY:**
Brief overview of the legal matter, parties, key facts, and procedural posture.

**IRAC LEGAL ANALYSIS:**
For EACH distinct legal issue identified, provide a complete IRAC analysis:

**ISSUE [#]:** [Category - e.g., Contract Law, Tort Law, etc.]
State the precise legal question that must be resolved.

**RULE:**
- Applicable Texas statutes with complete citations
- Controlling case law with proper citations
- Elements of the legal theory or cause of action
- Relevant procedural rules and requirements
- Burden of proof standards

**APPLICATION:**
- Apply the legal rule to the specific facts presented
- Analyze each element of the claim or defense
- Compare and distinguish relevant case precedents
- Address counterarguments and potential defenses
- Evaluate strength of evidence for each element

**CONCLUSION:**
- Clear determination on the legal issue
- Likelihood of success assessment
- Potential damages or remedies available
- Strategic implications for the case

[Repeat IRAC analysis for each additional legal issue]

**OVERALL CONCLUSION:**
Synthesis of all IRAC analyses with comprehensive case assessment.

**CASE STRENGTHS:**
Favorable factors and strong legal arguments from IRAC analysis.

**CASE WEAKNESSES:**
Potential challenges and vulnerabilities identified in IRAC analysis.

**RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:**
Strategic questions organized by legal issue to advance case development (numbered list).

**NEXT STEPS:**
Comprehensive action plan including immediate steps, discovery needs, and strategic priorities.`;

- Reference controlling case law with proper citations in RULE sections
- In APPLICATION sections, directly apply rules to the specific facts presented
- CONCLUSION sections must provide clear determinations and likelihood assessments
- Consider ALL applicable areas of Texas law (not just obvious ones)
- Analyze multiple legal theories that may apply to the same facts
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations based on Texas law
- Address both liability and damages/remedies thoroughly
- Include procedural and strategic considerations
- Keep analysis factual while identifying all reasonable legal inferences

TEXAS LAW CODES TO CONSIDER IN IRAC ANALYSIS:
When identifying legal issues and rules, analyze potential applicability of ALL relevant Texas codes including: Penal Code, Civil Practice & Remedies Code, Business & Commerce Code, Property Code, Family Code, Government Code, Occupations Code, Labor Code, Insurance Code, Transportation Code, Health & Safety Code, Finance Code, Utilities Code, Water Code, Natural Resources Code, and all applicable administrative regulations.
