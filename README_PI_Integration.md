# Personal Injury Dashboard Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan to transform the current mock data Personal Injury dashboard into a real data-driven AI-powered legal analysis system based on the extensive attorney thinking algorithm.

## Algorithm Foundation
Based on the comprehensive legal reasoning algorithm in `/public/algo.txt`, this integration leverages:

### Core Legal Reasoning Principles
1. **Healthy Skepticism** - Critical evaluation of all information
2. **Fact vs Information Distinction** - Verification of reliable data
3. **Relevance Assessment** - Information impact evaluation
4. **Hearsay Detection** - Second-hand account identification
5. **Opinion Evaluation** - Expert vs lay witness assessment
6. **Cross-Examination Mindset** - Credibility testing through questioning
7. **Evidence-Based Reasoning** - Verifiable fact requirement
8. **Contextual Analysis** - Broader information context consideration
9. **Deliberate Questioning** - Targeted issue analysis
10. **Ethical Consideration** - Responsible information dissemination

### Legal Analysis Framework
The algorithm implements a systematic approach:
- **Issue Identification** → **Information Gathering** → **Source Evaluation**
- **Fact Classification** → **Legal Theory Application** → **Argument Generation**
- **Counter-Argument Analysis** → **Risk Assessment** → **Strategy Determination**
- **Zealous Advocacy** → **Ethical Compliance** → **Continuous Improvement**

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Document Analysis Pipeline Integration ⚡ **CURRENT FOCUS**
**Goal**: Connect PI dashboard to actual case documents and extract relevant medical/legal data

#### Step 1.1: Medical Document Processing
- [ ] Create medical document parser for treatment records, diagnostic reports, imaging results
- [ ] Extract ICD-10 codes, treatment timelines, medical provider information
- [ ] Parse medication lists, therapy records, and recovery progress notes
- [ ] Implement fact vs hearsay classification for medical information

#### Step 1.2: Legal Document Analysis  
- [ ] Implement the attorney thinking algorithm for case analysis
- [ ] Extract incident details, witness statements, police reports
- [ ] Identify key legal elements: duty, breach, causation, damages
- [ ] Apply skepticism and relevance filters to document content

#### Step 1.3: Timeline Reconstruction
- [ ] Build automated timeline from document dates and events
- [ ] Create medical treatment chronology with reliability scoring
- [ ] Map incident progression and legal milestone tracking
- [ ] Cross-reference timeline events for consistency verification

### Phase 2: AI-Powered Case Analysis
**Goal**: Apply the legal reasoning algorithms to generate real insights

#### Step 2.1: Case Strength Assessment
- [ ] Implement the legal element analysis (duty, breach, causation, damages)
- [ ] Apply the "zealous advocacy" algorithm for thorough case evaluation
- [ ] Generate confidence scores based on evidence strength and reliability
- [ ] Implement counter-argument generation and evaluation

#### Step 2.2: Settlement Range Calculation
- [ ] Analyze similar cases using vectorized case law database
- [ ] Factor in medical costs, lost wages, pain and suffering
- [ ] Apply jurisdiction-specific damage award patterns
- [ ] Implement risk assessment algorithms for outcome prediction

#### Step 2.3: Medical Status Intelligence
- [ ] Track treatment progress and prognosis with skeptical analysis
- [ ] Identify gaps in medical documentation
- [ ] Flag potential complications or missed diagnoses
- [ ] Apply expert vs lay opinion classification to medical assessments

### Phase 3: Real-Time Dashboard Updates
**Goal**: Replace mock data with live analysis results

#### Step 3.1: Database Schema Updates
- [ ] Create tables for medical analyses, timeline events, case metrics
- [ ] Store extracted ICD-10 codes with legal significance mappings
- [ ] Track document processing status and analysis completeness
- [ ] Implement reliability scoring storage for all data points

#### Step 3.2: Dashboard Data Integration
- [ ] Connect PIAnalysisContent to real database queries
- [ ] Implement real-time updates as new documents are processed
- [ ] Add data freshness indicators and processing status
- [ ] Show confidence levels and reliability scores in UI

#### Step 3.3: Interactive Features
- [ ] Allow attorneys to validate/correct AI analysis
- [ ] Enable manual input for missing information
- [ ] Provide drill-down capabilities for detailed evidence review
- [ ] Implement attorney feedback loop for continuous improvement

### Phase 4: Advanced Analytics & Insights
**Goal**: Leverage the full algorithm for strategic recommendations

#### Step 4.1: Comparative Case Analysis
- [ ] Find similar cases using vectorized document search
- [ ] Analyze outcome patterns and success factors
- [ ] Provide precedent-based recommendations
- [ ] Implement contextual analysis for case similarities

#### Step 4.2: Strategic Planning Integration
- [ ] Apply the "determine strategy" algorithm for action recommendations
- [ ] Generate discovery request suggestions based on gaps identified
- [ ] Identify key expert witness needs
- [ ] Implement ethical compliance checks for all recommendations

#### Step 4.3: Risk Assessment & Monitoring
- [ ] Implement the risk analysis framework from the algorithm
- [ ] Track statute of limitations and key deadlines
- [ ] Monitor case development against benchmarks
- [ ] Provide continuous self-reflection and improvement suggestions
